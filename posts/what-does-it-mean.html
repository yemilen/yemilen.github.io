                <p>Ok, finally first post. I have thought about blogging for quite a while. But given that English is not my native language I feared that it won't be up to par. I also have noticed when I write, I tend to write very informally. A habit I am trying to break. But, this is my blog and surely I can break rules here. So I thought I start on a good note. As I finalize writing my thesis, I am thinking about what methods and processes I enjoyed and which ones I dreaded during my PhD at UvA. The first thing that came to my mind is meaning. So here we go, my short reflection on how I enjoyed asking "what does it mean?".</p>

                <p>For example, let's take the purpose limitation principle of the GDPR [Article 5(1)(b)]. It states that personal data must be 'collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes.' So then naturally, one asks what is purpose really? What does 'specified' mean in practice? What is considered as 'legitimate'? Then I had to look up research on purpose, find a whole PhD thesis dedicated for purpose with meaning and everything. Understanding purposes as actions vs labels. GDPR further specifies that controllers have a "duty" for instance to inform data subjects when purposes change. What is duty really? Is it an action, a relationship? Then finding whole PhD dedicated to duties and obligations. Sometimes I had to remind myself that I am not a lawyer. I simply need to provide their technical specification. However, for someone designing systems that can enforce these regulations, I think it matters that I ask these questions.</p>

                <p>English isn't my native language, which might be why I obsess over exact meanings. I always fear that maybe I am missing something crucial. I also understand that the law is intentionally written to allow for broad interpretations. But then, what does "broad" actually mean? How broad is too broad? At what point does flexibility become vagueness? Obviously, it's probably not vague for a legal expert. However, if you are trying to translate legal requirements into code, for making binary decisions, that vagueness becomes a sort of obstacle. But then how are we supposed to bridge code and law? Because not every development team will have a lawyer. Which is why we need interdisciplinary lawyers these days, which I guess we have and are emerging. So this is not a criticism but me thinking out loud. But what I am saying is that I enjoyed it, I enjoyed asking "what does it mean?".</p>

                <p>I sometimes wonder, what if in the distant future, we will be writing law from code instead of code from law. It's a scary thought but also maybe fascinating. We would have to evolve into a society without ambiguity, vagueness—everything that makes us human. It will be a robotic society. Our humanness will be gone. Reminds me of the movie, Equilibrium. I think law derived from code might work in that society. I mean if we last a million years from now, we will have enough data to generate law from code, I mean maybe a 100 years (I am just spitting numbers). Oh this reminds me of the series Foundation, no matter how predictable we become there will always be that one outlier. But in Foundation, the model didn't account for the outlier, what if we have a model that accounts for the outlier? I digress. Law from code, a bane of our existence or a hope for survival?</p>
